#Total variation distance privacy

------
Total Variation Distance privacy (TVD privacy) as the maximum difference between the output distributions of two neighboring datasets. This project provides measures of differential privacy and total variation distance privacy under specific privacy goals. This project also provides the code for the total variable distance privacy metric DP-SGD algorithm.

This project provides matlab code to execute in version 2015b.
