#Total variation distance privacy

------
Total Variation Distance privacy (TVD privacy) as the maximum difference between the output distributions of two neighboring datasets. This project provides measures of differential privacy and total variation distance privacy under specific privacy indicators. 

compute_dp_sgd_privacy.py can use to compute the total variation distance privacy for DP-SGD algorithm.
